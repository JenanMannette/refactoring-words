# Refactoring Words

Consider the meaning of each sentence. 

How can we say each in fewer words? 

Refactor each sentance to be more consise, less confusing, or better formatted.

### Example:

```
The cat is purple. The cat is purple and being silly.
```

The purple cat is being silly.

### Exercise:

```
Samus will eventually ride her spaceship to another planet.
```

```
Samus will eventually transport from one place to another from earth to another planet.
```

```
Link is the hero of Hyrule.
```

```
Zelda is also the hero, too.
```

```
Gannon is a beast.
```

```
Within an hour of a teenage boy smoking his first marijuana cigareete, he will laugh at the thought of a horse riding a jockey.
```

```
